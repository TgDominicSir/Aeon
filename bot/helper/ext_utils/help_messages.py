Notes:
1. Add <code>-del</code> to the list(s) which you want from the bot to delete the original files after command run complete!
2. To execute one of pre-added lists in bot like: ({"subtitle": ["-i mltb.mkv -c copy -c:s srt mltb.mkv"]}), you must use -ff subtitle (list key)
Examples: ["-i mltb.mkv -c copy -c:s srt mltb.mkv", "-i mltb.video -c copy -c:s srt mltb", "-i mltb.m4a -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 mltb.mp3", "-i mltb.audio -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 mltb.mp3", "-i mltb -map 0:a -c copy mltb.mka -map 0:s -c copy mltb.srt"]
Here I will explain how to use mltb.* which is reference to files you want to work on.
1. First cmd: the input is mltb.mkv so this cmd will work only on mkv videos and the output is mltb.mkv also so all outputs is mkv. -del will delete the original media after complete run of the cmd.
2. Second cmd: the input is mltb.video so this cmd will work on all videos and the output is only mltb so the extension is same as input files.
3. Third cmd: the input in mltb.m4a so this cmd will work only on m4a audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
4. Fourth cmd: the input is mltb.audio so this cmd will work on all audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
